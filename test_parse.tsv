The overall form and coloration emulate those of the bell-shaped cotton flower, and the rock-crystal cover represents the white boll. Upon the completion of the vase, Tiffany & Co. proudly produced a booklet detailing the process of its creation.

38634.html	Crowned  Bodhisattva|Crowned  Bodhisattva	3rd–early 4th century|3rd–early 4th century	North India (Uttar Pradesh, Mathura)		This youthful Buddhist savior, with curled lockets of hairs cascading to his shoulders, is amongst the most appealing images of this figure type from early India. He is broad shouldered with a slender waist, the archetypal Kushan physiognomy of the universal monarch (chakravartin) Buddha-type. This concept is carried through to the exceptional treatment of the head decoration, with its distinguished crown and the presiding parent Buddha. In keeping with works of the Kushan school at Mathura, the facial details are sharply carved, conveying a plasticity and a conventionalized naturalism to the face. The forehead mark (urna), textually described as a tuft of hair but typically represented as a raised dot, is an auspicious sign of nobility and accepted as one of the Buddha’s lakshanas, denoting Buddhahood.  The bodhisattva’s chest is adorned with an elaborate array of jewelry. Close to the neck is a string of large pearls with a rectangular centerpiece likely intended to be a gemstone. Below this is a flat torque, with incised décor. Overlaying these is a massive necklace consisting of five strands of pearls with traces of mythical makaras with crocodile-like jaws serving as the terminals. Line drawings of related designs confirm this identification. Next is a woven cord from which hangs a discus ornament with six bell-shaped pendants. Attached to this is another cord which carries three cylindrical amulet cases slung across the lower chest, as routinely seen on Gandharan-region bodhisattvas. Finally, he wears a sacred cord which extends from his left shoulder to his waist. A nearly identical configuration of jewelry is seen on a male torso fragment from Mathura (Vogel 1930, pl. XXXIVa), and with slight variation on the life sized meditating bodhisattva in Lucknow.  The Mathura torso also displays tapering strands of long hair on the shoulders, treated in our sculpture as cascading curls. Both works are rare in displaying long uncut hair, and likely were produced in response to rival imagery of the Jina Rishabhanatha, the first of the Jain saviors.

3740420200519.html	Vase with Incised and Impressed Designs|Vase with Incised and Impressed Designs	3600–1000 B.C.|3600–1000 B.C.	Thailand (Ban Chiang)		Ban Chiang on the Khorat Plateau in northwest Thailand, one of the most famous archaeological sites in the country, is noted for the production of a wide range of technologically and aesthetically sophisticated ceramics dating from the third millennium B.C. to the third century A.D. As a result, similar works, of unknown provenance, are often attributed to this site. It is possible, however, that many such items were made at related but less well known centers on the plateau or elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia.  This striking beaker-shaped vessel is typical of works attributed to the earliest phases at Ban Chiang. It was formed in two pieces: a large open-mouthed container with a rounded base that is placed into a shorter pedestal with a broad foot. A prominent flange conceals the seams where the two sections are joined. Covering the entire surface of the vessel, exuberant curvilinear forms were first incised and then further elaborated with impressed decoration. The dark gray color of the vessel is the result of both firing in hot wood first and the glow of oxygen over the vessel as the fire died down. Traces of burnishing are visible on the surface of the vessel, particularly in the interior.

459087.html	Christ Carrying the Cross|Christ Carrying the Cross	ca. 1577–87|ca. 1577–87	El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos)	Greek	During his long career in Spain, El Greco produced numerous paintings of Christ carrying the cross. The Lehman canvas, arguably his earliest version of the subject, is not a narrative scene: no other figures are represented and the setting is not recognizable. Instead, it is a devotional image of haunting immediacy and resonant with pathos. Christ's willing sacrifice for mankind is expressed through his gentle embrace of the cross and his heavenward gaze.

Brown in Sterling et al. 1998, p. 173). At least seven versions of this composition are known, not including those of a somewhat different type in which Christ gazes to the upper left and holds an upright cross (see Christiansen in New York-London 2003-4, p. 148, noting the influence on this type of Michelangelo’s marble Risen Christ in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome). Considering its style and exceptional quality, the Museum’s Christ Carrying the Cross is likely to have been the first that El Greco painted in Spain.|The subject, which isolates Christ from narrative scenes of the Way to Calvary, was developed mainly by northern Italian artists of the early 1500s such as Giovanni Bellini, Sebastiano del Piombo, Andrea Solario, and others. El Greco probably saw Sebastiano’s Christ Carrying the Cross (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), painted in the mid-1530s for Fernando da Silva, 4th Conde de Cifuentes (d. 1546), who took it to Spain where it entered the royal collection. The picture, on slate, was treasured by Philip II and hung in the monastery of El Escorial. It was evidently well known to certain artists, in particular Luis de Morales (ca. 1520–1586?) who painted several versions of the composition, with a more pathetic and cadaverous Christ (one example, dated 1566, is in the Museo del Patriarca, Valencia).|In El Greco’s treatment of the subject he departs strongly from the suffering type of Christ, bent under the weight of the cross, and established a new type in which the Savior looks rapturously up to God, and embraces the cross as an instrument of his own salvation. The frontal pose and upward glance recall some paintings of the Risen Christ by North Italian masters (such as Ambrogio Bergognone and Andrea Previtali), and of martyred saints such as Saint Sebastian. During the late 1570s and early 1580s El Greco painted a number of saints, and Christ himself, in similar attitudes, for example Saint Sebastian (the large canvas in Palencia, of about 1577–78), Mary Magdalene in Penitence (early 1580s; Worcester Art Museum), Saint Peter in Penitence (1580s; the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, County Durham), and the serene figure of Christ, indifferent to his tormentors, in The Disrobing of Christ (""El Espolio""), of 1577–79, in the sacristy of Toledo Cathedral.|El Greco’s idea of Christ Carrying the Cross was a remarkable departure from the norm in Spain, where an emphasis on his suffering is found throughout the 1500s and 1600s, in paintings, polychromed wooden sculpture, religious processions, and spiritual literature. It seems likely that Saint Teresa of Avila (1515–1582), who had influential followers in Toledo, may be counted among those who encouraged El Greco’s conception of Christ in several types of devotional image, as a figure in mystical communication with God and in a state of divine Grace beyond worldly sensation (the crown of thorns and heavy cross make no impression here). As objects of contemplation the artist’s versions of this subject must have been an inspiration to hope and faith.|[Walter Liedtke 2014]"	"/art/metpublications/The_Robert_Lehman_Collection_Vol_2_Fifteenth_to_Eighteenth_Century_European_Paintings_France_Ce–The Robert Lehman Collection.

This panel, which would have been set into the harmika at the top of a stupa (relic mound), shows the Buddha surrounded by lay and monastic mourners in various states of grief. Their reactions are contrasted with the perfect calm of the monk with his back turned, Subhadra, who realizes there is no reason for sorrow, as the Buddha has reached nirvana. Iconic images of the Buddha's death, based on the Gandharan prototype, became important icons for veneration across the Buddhist world in following centuries.

38237.html	Buddha|Buddha	3rd century A.D.|3rd century A.D.	South India (ancient Andhradesa, probably Nagarjunakonda)		This figure of the Buddha stands in the classic pose of the “universal ruler” (chakravartin) figure-type. His powerful idealized physique exemplifies his status as a spiritual leader amongst men. The universal gesture of early Buddha imagery is that of the raised hand extending protection to devotees (abhayamudra), which is what this Buddha would have done in its complete state.   The sculpture is worked in-the-round, with the deeply cut fluting of the monastic robes extending fully behind. The ‘Gothic folds’ on the robe’s hem on the back are a particularly pleasing and unexpected detail given that such images were often installed in blind niches. The fully worked nature of this sculpture suggests that it was one favored for installation in an apsidal shrine where monks and nuns could have circumambulated the freestanding image.      It is the rhythmic fall of the robe and the ‘weight’ of the folds which give to this figure such grace and elegance. A wonderfully naturalistic touch is how the sculptor has allowed the powerful physique of the Buddha to emerge, dispelling the folds where the robe is drawn taut over the Buddha’s left shoulder.

Thailand (Ban Chiang)		Ban Chiang on the Khorat Plateau in northwest Thailand, one of the most famous archaeological sites in the country, is noted for the production of a wide range of technologically and aesthetically sophisticated ceramics dating from the third millennium B.C. to the third century A.D. As a result, similar works, of unknown provenance, are often attributed to this site. It is possible, however, that many such items were made at related but less well known centers on the plateau or elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia.  This striking beaker-shaped vessel is typical of works attributed to the earliest phases at Ban Chiang. It was formed in two pieces: a large open-mouthed container with a rounded base that is placed into a shorter pedestal with a broad foot. A prominent flange conceals the seams where the two sections are joined. Covering the entire surface of the vessel, exuberant curvilinear forms were first incised and then further elaborated with impressed decoration. The dark gray color of the vessel is the result of both firing in hot wood first and the glow of oxygen over the vessel as the fire died down. Traces of burnishing are visible on the surface of the vessel, particularly in the interior.

335663.html	Youth Playing a Pipe for a Satyr|Youth Playing a Pipe for a Satyr	1645–50|1645–50	Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (Il Grechetto)	Italian	The artist ventured here with spellbinding bravura into the bucolic world of satyrs and nymphs, attaining the effect of a deliberately unfinished easel painting.  The satyr has finished playing his shepherd's pipe and sprawls out with hedonistic abandon as he listens to the beautiful youth take his turn on a pipe.  The satyr may represent Pan or Marsyas, while the youth may be Apollo, Olympos, or Daphnis.  None of the Classical myths provides an entirely consistent fit with the composition, but it evokes a gentle, idyllic contest.  It may allude to the contrast between the passionate spirit of the Dionysian (as represented by the satyr) and the beauty and clarity of reason of the Apollonian (the youth), which, according to Renaissance and Baroque humanists, were the two opposing impulses of artistic creativity.
